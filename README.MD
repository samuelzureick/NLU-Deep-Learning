# Project Overview
This is a project composed of two tasks. The first task is to perform 50-means clustering on reviews using using semantic word embeddings to predict what product a particular review is for. 

The second task is to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews using dense word representations with an LSTM, and evaluate this model using k-fold cross validation.
